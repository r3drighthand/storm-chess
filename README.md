# Storm Chess

Play chess against a weather-controlled AI. When local weather conditions are fair, the AI's playing style will match the weather report for that area. But when playing during a thunderstorm, your opponent's difficulty setting will increase dramatically and the AI will play much more aggressively. 

With Storm Chess, you can literally play chess with the weather.
